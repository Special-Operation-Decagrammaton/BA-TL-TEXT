10052060-0002 = "We have entered Kether's area."
10052060-0003 = "I still don't understand the meaning, but they say Sephiroth's number is 1."
10052060-0004 = "Wow... That's amazing, Toki! Aris didn't even know that!"
10052060-0005 = "I just read the prophet's notation information. Cute Aris."
10052060-0006 = "Toki, you're so meticulous! I think it's amazing enough!"
10052060-0007 = "Thank you. I'll give you a pat."
10052060-0008 = "Yes!"
10052060-0015 = "Kether can also be called the first prophet..."
10052060-0016 = "It was quite a while later that we encountered Kether."
10052060-0017 = "Do you remember? It was in the submerged ruins area."
10052060-0018 = "[s] \"Yeah. We played tag, didn't we.\""
10052060-0019 = "Yes. We were 'it'."
10052060-0020 = "[s] \"Himari was there too, which is unusual.\""
10052060-0021 = "I've heard that story too. She was so excited, her eyes sparkling like a child's, wanting to see the Decagrammaton directly."
10052060-0022 = "I heard a similar story."
10052060-0023 = "...Both of you, who on earth told you such a rumor? Was it Rio?"
10052060-0024 = "It was Eimi."
10052060-0025 = "Is that so... Eimi sometimes can't grasp things intuitively."
10052060-0026 = "I just said what I saw honestly?"
10052060-0027 = "Eimi!?"
10052060-0028 = "(It was true...)"
10052060-0029 = "It's okay, Himari-senpai! Aris also feels that way the day before a new game is released!"
10052060-0030 = "R-really? Oh, no, I wasn't excited or anything at that time, you know?"
10052060-0031 = "I just hoped that if I could witness one of the 'phenomena' called the Decagrammaton with my own eyes, I might be able to put an end to the commotion."
10052060-0032 = "In the end, just when I thought one thing was settled, another possibility opened up..."
10052060-0033 = "And before I knew it, we ended up in the current situation."
10052060-0034 = "It was a critical mistake on my part that I couldn't predict this outcome and prepare for it."
10052060-0035 = "Himari-buchou, did you gain some kind of precognitive ability while I wasn't looking?"
10052060-0036 = "Of course not. Of course, that's one of the reasons I study the occult..."
10052060-0037 = "I haven't reached a definitive answer in that area yet."
10052060-0038 = "Then why are you trying to take responsibility for an outcome you couldn't predict?"
10052060-0039 = "...!"
10052060-0040 = "(Well said, Toki)"
10052060-0041 = "Well said, Toki."
10052060-0046 = "Um... excuse me for interrupting..."
10052060-0047 = "Are we descending again!?"
10052060-0048 = "That's right. It's the most rational approach."
10052060-0049 = "Yes. It's the most strategic method."
10052060-0050 = "It would be difficult to break through Kether's crossfire via the ground route."
10052060-0051 = "Don't worry about the safety during descent."
10052060-0052 = "Besides, haven't we experienced descent operations many times already?"
10052060-0053 = "Just because we have a lot of experience doesn't mean it's not scary...!"
10052060-0054 = "Yuzu is speaking up more than usual. This is proof that she's genuinely scared."
10052060-0055 = "But the descent pods actively incorporate the opinions of everyone in the game development club, you know?"
10052060-0056 = "I just didn't think I'd be the one using it!"
10052060-0057 = "Everyone, it's time to descend. Please prepare."
10052060-0058 = "Eeeek!?"
10052060-0059 = "Yuzu, are you alright?"
10052060-0060 = "As I thought, this is...!"
10052060-0061 = "Descent team, please board the pods. I repeat—"
10052060-0062 = "Descent pod launch preparation complete."
10052060-0069 = "Well then, shall we begin?"
10052060-0070 = "Leave the front to me."
10052060-0072 = "Himari-buchou, Momoi. Please provide cover."
10052060-0073 = "Eeeeeeeek...!"
10052060-0075 = "Descent commencing!"
10052060-0077 = "Alright... I just need to push this lever, right?"
10052060-0078 = "Onee-chan... Please be careful."
10052060-0079 = "I'm being completely serious!"
10052060-0086 = "Kyaaaaaaaaah—!!!"
10052060-0087 = "(What a terrifying scream...)"
