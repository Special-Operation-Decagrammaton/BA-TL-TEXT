10052195-0138 = "But games aren't like that. They aren't made that way."
10052195-0140 = "Because games contain the hopes of people who envision a 'beautiful world.'"

10052195-0178 = "Yes. No matter how many times you ask, Aris's choice will not change."
10052195-0179 = "Just as Sensei did!"
10052195-0180 = "If you make that choice—you will become nothing more than an ordinary student from now on."
10052195-0181 = "Furthermore, you will exhaust all possibilities remaining within yourself."
