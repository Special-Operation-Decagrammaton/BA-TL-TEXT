90002080-0003 = "This Steel Continent is the 7th Prophet, Netzach, evolved to its extreme and expanded in existence."
90002080-0004 = "In the process, Netzach lost its original form."
90002080-0005 = "And here, all the Decagrammaton Prophets are gathered."
90002080-0006 = "Strictly speaking, they appear to be replicas... but that doesn't mean they differ from the originals."
90002080-0007 = "Replicas, I see. That explains it."
90002080-0008 = "Their plan must be to cover Kivotos with the Steel Continent, allowing them to integrate with the originals at any time."
90002080-0009 = "Now... we have a problem."
90002080-0010 = "A problem?"
90002080-0011 = "The Prophets seem to be guarding their assigned areas...#nHowever, we haven't been able to pinpoint their locations yet."
90002080-0012 = "So, the information is highly concealed, after all?"
90002080-0013 = "Yes. To put it more simply—"
90002080-0014 = "It's like they're very good at hide-and-seek."
90002080-0015 = "Nevertheless, we have grasped information about the Prophets."
90002080-0016 = "Information on previous Prophets can be found in the 'Tree of Life' research data, so I will omit it here."
90002080-0017 = "First, 'Netzach,' the Steel Continent itself.#nIts alias is 'Infinite Land Proving Victory,' and its Path is 'Victory Finally Reached.'"
90002080-0022 = "A straightforward alias."
90002080-0023 = "Next, 'Yesod,' who has gone missing.#nIts alias is 'Purifier of Power Governing the Foundation.'"
90002080-0024 = "Its Path is said to be 'Truth Progressing Towards Completion.'"
90002080-0029 = "Oh, excuse me for a moment. I've been wondering, what are these aliases and Paths?#nDo they increase efficiency or something?"
90002080-0030 = "I don't know the details either.#nHowever, it seems they adjust energy flow based on the Paths."
90002080-0031 = "Their purpose is said to be to reach new possibilities."
90002080-0032 = "New possibilities?"
90002080-0033 = "...I don't know either."
90002080-0034 = "Oh, I see. Kei doesn't know a lot of things either!"
90002080-0035 = "Huh!?"
90002080-0036 = "Sis! Why would you say that!#nKei-chan, I'm sorry..."
90002080-0037 = "Phew... It's alright, Midori. It's nothing to worry about."
90002080-0038 = "Oh? So you're not denying it?"
90002080-0039 = "MOMOI!!!!"
90002080-0043 = "Hahahaha! Kei got angry!"
90002080-0044 = "Sigh..."
90002080-0045 = "I can't deal with this, let's get back to the topic.#nFinally, there's 'Malkuth.' Its alias is 'Pilgrim of the Kingdom Reaching the World's End.'"
90002080-0046 = "Its Path is... 'A Single Will Created Beneath the Banner.'"
90002080-0054 = "Oh? That sounds pretty cool. Maybe I'll use it as a reference for the next game."
90002080-0055 = "Perhaps that would be for the best."
90002080-0056 = "Huh? You're not angry this time?"
90002080-0057 = "Meaningless wordplay and settings expanded by inside jokes—"
90002080-0058 = "I thought it would be better if they were used in Momoi's scenario, for a better fit."
90002080-0059 = "K-Kei-chan... saying that much is..."
90002080-0060 = "...You're right, I might have gone a bit too far.#nMomoi, I apologize."
90002080-0061 = "Huh?"
90002080-0062 = "Why am I being apologized to?"
90002080-0063 = "...Well, it's fine. Momoi was always like this anyway..."
90002080-0064 = "W-Was that... okay...?"
90002080-0065 = "In any case, the biggest problem is Malkuth."
90002080-0066 = "We can't stand a chance against it in our current state."
90002080-0067 = "Just now, we could have been wiped out. #nThe only reason we're still here is because Malkuth inexplicably retreated."
90002080-0068 = "...As if it were being pursued by something."
90002080-0069 = "[s] \"Why do you think that happened?\""
90002080-0070 = "Well...#nThe first possibility is that Malkuth's operational time might be extremely short."
90002080-0075 = "Does that mean it's only designed for short, decisive battles?"
90002080-0076 = "Not practical for real combat. Standardization and normalization are crucial."
90002080-0077 = "Combat is all about overwhelming numbers."
90002080-0083 = "...Or perhaps it's intended for uses other than combat."
90002080-0084 = "Are you saying it has some other role?"
90002080-0086 = "Unfortunately, we don't have time for a discussion here."
90002080-0087 = "To summarize the information...#nIt's certain that the Steel Continent is divided by Prophet assignments."
90002080-0088 = "And it should be possible to 'occupy' each area and bring it under our control."
90002080-0089 = "...Come to think of it, the enemies haven't attacked since then."
90002080-0090 = "I missed the timing to say it, but this area has been fully occupied."
90002080-0091 = "Specifically, at the time of Malkuth's attack."
90002080-0092 = "Since the occupation, Decagrammaton soldiers and laborers have ceased activity."
90002080-0093 = "As expected.#nBy occupying it electronically, we can stop enemy support to that region."
90002080-0098 = "And if we succeed in occupying an area...#nWe should be able to draw out the Prophets."
90002080-0099 = "Finally, something important. The Prophets seem to possess something called an 'Information Core.'#nIf we defeat them and retrieve it, I believe I can absorb it into my body."
90002080-0100 = "...Because this body was created on the Steel Continent."
90002080-0101 = "What benefit would that have?"
90002080-0102 = "The more Information Cores I absorb, the more the Steel Continent will perceive me as—"
90002080-0103 = "A collective of Prophets, or a higher existence."
90002080-0104 = "If we collect all the Information Cores, I believe I can issue commands to the Steel Continent."
90002080-0105 = "For example, commands like 'halt expansion' or 'cease operation.'"
90002080-0106 = "[s] \"Then, this situation too...!\""
90002080-0107 = "Yes. We might be able to resolve it fundamentally."
90002080-0111 = "..."
90002080-0112 = "I see! So, if we occupy an area and defeat the boss, Kei levels up!"
90002080-0113 = "Kei, reaching max level and gaining the qualifications, will stop the Steel Continent!#nThat's game clear!"
90002080-0114 = "I think that's a good analogy. However..."
90002080-0115 = "Is it different...?"
90002080-0116 = "The Prophets we can fight right now are 8, not 10."
90002080-0117 = "In other words... we can only raise the level to 80, not 100."
90002080-0119 = "Come to think of it... indeed?"
90002080-0120 = "Because there's currently no way to defeat Netzach and Malkuth..."
90002080-0122 = "Even so, this is arguably the only method."
90002080-0123 = "Above all, it should be able to impede the Steel Continent's activities to some extent."
90002080-0124 = "[s] \"Then, our goal from now on is...\""
90002080-0129 = "Yes. After occupying the areas and defeating the Prophets—"
90002080-0130 = "We'll retrieve the core information and have Kei store it."
90002080-0131 = "If all goes well, this will stop the Steel Continent."
90002080-0132 = "It's decided then."
90002080-0133 = "In that case, appropriate preparations will be necessary."
90002080-0134 = "[s] \"Meaning?\""
90002080-0135 = "Abi-Eshuh is unusable."
90002080-0136 = "All external parts were destroyed in the battle with Malkuth.#nThe damage extends to the internal frame."
90002080-0137 = "However, if we extract the still-functional parts, recycling is possible.#nConsidering all these conditions—"
90002080-0138 = "I believe the best course of action is to have our dear Aris inherit Abi-Eshuh."
90002080-0140 = "What!? Abi-Eshuh to Aris!?"
90002080-0141 = "We should try everything we can."
90002080-0142 = "However, time is the problem."
90002080-0143 = "Extracting parts from the current Abi-Eshuh, re-maintaining them, then modifying them to fit Aris's body. The time required for all this work is..."
90002080-0144 = "Re-equipping is necessary for all of us."
90002080-0145 = "But right now, just maintaining this region is all we can manage..."
90002080-0149 = "..."
90002080-0150 = "Specifically, what do we need?"
90002080-0152 = "Huh?"
90002080-0153 = "Broadly speaking, two types: things we need directly, and#nthings needed to prepare them."
90002080-0154 = "We are severely short-handed, and AMAS is almost completely destroyed.#nFurthermore, including various facilities to aid automation—"
90002080-0160 = "[ns] \"Um...\""
90002080-0162 = "Th-That sounds like building a new factory..."
90002080-0167 = "It is unrealistic. Nevertheless, we must somehow find a way..."
90002080-0169 = "If we get those, we'll manage, right?"
90002080-0171 = "!?"
90002080-0172 = "!?"
90002080-0174 = "K-Kei? Aris doesn't quite understand, but wouldn't it be difficult to prepare those...?"
90002080-0175 = "No, we can do it."
90002080-0176 = "Aris and I can do as much as needed."
90002080-0177 = "Kei and Aris, you mean...?"
90002080-0178 = "Yes. Material reconstruction is one of the representative powers of the Nameless Gods."
90002080-0179 = "And the Steel Continent has been reconstructed using that power."
90002080-0180 = "I believe I heard about it before we departed... Hah, could it be!?"
90002080-0181 = "Precisely."
90002080-0182 = "Is it possible!?"
90002080-0183 = "If I'm with Aris."
90002080-0184 = "But Aris doesn't know what to do..."
90002080-0185 = "It's alright, Aris. It's just like that time."
90002080-0190 = "This place is filled with the power of the Nameless Gods more than anywhere else.#nI realized that during the battle with Malkuth."
90002080-0191 = "Although it has been arranged in various ways... I don't think it's unusable."
90002080-0192 = "Moreover, having obtained this body, I should be able to regulate energy more precisely than before."
90002080-0193 = "Therefore, let's show them here."
90002080-0194 = "What we can do. What kind of existence I was."
90002080-0200 = "What we were originally meant to be."
90002080-0201 = "Aris... what should I do?"
90002080-0216 = "It's simple. Look into my eyes. Just like that time."
90002080-0217 = "Aris—your hand. This will be the path connecting you and me."
90002080-0218 = "Now, imagine."
90002080-0233 = "Imagine, you say...?"
90002080-0234 = "Yes. What everyone needs. What Rio just spoke about.#nAbi-Eshuh's frame, and things based on it."
90002080-0235 = "...What you intend to accomplish."
90002080-0236 = "A general idea is enough. I will fill in the details.#nAris... you just need to imagine."
90002080-0240 = "There's no need to be afraid."
90002080-0241 = "Like that night when the aurora descended."
90002080-0255 = "May all of you be filled with unseen possibilities—"
90002080-0260 = "Aris-chan... Kei-chan..."
90002080-0262 = "Amazing... it's like a game..."
90002080-0263 = "Yeah... maybe Sis's analogy is accurate this time..."
90002080-0264 = "Aris...?"
90002080-0269 = "...?"
90002080-0270 = "Eh, wh-what!? Aris has acquired incredibly powerful-looking armor!#nWhat in the world is this...!?"
90002080-0272 = "It is one possibility that 'we' have reached."
90002080-0273 = "So this is... Aris's Abi-Eshuh."
90002080-0274 = "Well, President?#nWhat are your thoughts on witnessing this 'singular phenomenon'?"
90002080-0275 = "Everything has been a singular phenomenon since we arrived here.#nBut this is the most impressive among them—"
90002080-0277 = "A moving singular phenomenon."
90002080-0279 = "Next; Dress Up"
