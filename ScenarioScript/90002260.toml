90002260-0013 = "It's a god-tier game, obviously! After all, the scenario is based on our recent experiences!"
90002260-0014 = "Yeah. We managed to secure plenty of art resources, too."
90002260-0016 = "Aris worked hard on the coating, too!"
90002260-0022 = "...Um."
90002260-0023 = "What is this...?"
90002260-0024 = "It's a game?"
90002260-0025 = "I admire your courage in insisting that this is a game."
90002260-0026 = "However, I think you should try to be a bit more objective."
90002260-0027 = "What!?"
90002260-0029 = "Why...?"
90002260-0030 = "U-Ugh..."
90002260-0032 = "Waaaaah!"
90002260-0034 = "First of all, the world-building is bizarre. This is a fantasy game, right? #nSo why does a giant kaiju robot suddenly appear in the middle of a snowy field?"
90002260-0035 = "Heh heh heh... It seems you still don't understand the meaning of 'romance'..."
90002260-0036 = "No, even 'romance' has its limits."
90002260-0037 = "If you just do whatever you want, it's not romance—it's self-indulgence."
90002260-0041 = "And the giant kaiju robot would be one thing..."
90002260-0043 = "But why do we suddenly enter imaginary space?! And the controls are terrible!!"
90002260-0044 = "I-It's a giant kaiju robot, of course it's not going to be easy to control! #nThat's part of the romance!"
90002260-0045 = "Romance is romance precisely because it's anachronistic!"
90002260-0046 = "I'm telling you, that's just self-indulgence!!"
90002260-0047 = "No way!"
90002260-0048 = "And what's with these enemies? This is the seventh shrimp-type enemy since we entered imaginary space!"
90002260-0049 = "B-But they're all different colors..."
90002260-0050 = "They're still just shrimps!"
90002260-0051 = "T-That's a technique called 'color variation'! #nIt's to reduce resources and optimize the invested assets...!"
90002260-0052 = "Even so, do you really need seven different color swaps?"
90002260-0053 = "There's a limit to color variations!"
90002260-0054 = "We spent too much time focusing on drawing the penguins at the start, so we ran out of time..."
90002260-0055 = "Because penguins are cuter than shrimps..."

90002260-0063 = "Why are 'Dash', 'Roll', and 'Jump' all mapped to the same button during combat!?"
90002260-0064 = "W-Well, if you press and release immediately, it's a 'Roll'... #nAnd if you hold it for about 3 frames, it's a 'Jump'."
90002260-0065 = "If you hold it for another 3 frames after that, it becomes a 'Dash'..."
90002260-0066 = "T-They're all evasive maneuvers... #nSo I thought it would be more convenient to put them on one button..."
90002260-0067 = "B-By the way, there's more."
90002260-0068 = "If you parry at the exact moment of a roll... and succeed in a 1-frame Just Parry..."
90002260-0069 = "Y-You can get behind the boss and deal massive damage... so please give it some practice..."
90002260-0070 = "Why are you basing the game's controls on your own skill level!?"
90002260-0071 = "I can't perform such precise inputs! In fact, most people can't!"
90002260-0072 = "K-Kei-chan, you can do it if you try hard enough...! Probably..."
90002260-0073 = "Yuzu... not everyone in the world can be a pro gamer like you..."
90002260-0074 = "And that mid-boss earlier, wasn't that just cruel? #nI finally beat it while putting up with those terrible controls, and then it has a revival mechanic!?"
90002260-0075 = "I mean, once would be understandable. But repeating it two or three times is just too much!"
90002260-0076 = "W-Was it not fun...?"
90002260-0081 = "I thought it was a form of torture!"
90002260-0082 = "Uuuugh..."
90002260-0083 = "Lastly... this screen is flickering a bit, isn't it? Is it a bug?"
90002260-0084 = "I was almost hit by a meteor thrown by that yellow imaginary space shrimp!"
90002260-0085 = "Aris did the coating for that part. I am sorry..."
90002260-0089 = "I see. Well, that can't be helped then. You're still getting used to things."
90002260-0095 = "In fact, I should praise you for getting this far. As expected of Aris."
90002260-0097 = "Hey, hey! Aren't you being way too soft on Aris!?"
90002260-0098 = "It's the difference in your daily behavior. #nFirst, you need to repent for the giant kaiju robot and the imaginary space."
90002260-0099 = "Gah..."
90002260-0104 = "So, when can I play the official version of this?"

90002260-0112 = "Coming from you, Sis, that's very convincing..."
90002260-0113 = "To make a good game, you have to play a lot of games!"
90002260-0114 = "Yeah, yeah. I've heard that a hundred times already..."
90002260-0116 = "Wait, Toki, didn't you say you didn't have any hobbies?"
90002260-0117 = "It's not that I don't have any. I'm just looking for them."
90002260-0118 = "And recently, I've become [ruby=・]slight[/ruby][ruby=・]ly[/ruby] interested in games, manga, and internet streaming."
90002260-0119 = "Slightly? You seem to be spending an awful lot of time here for 'slightly'..."

90002260-0133 = "K-Kei!? Don't collapse!"
90002260-0134 = "That conversation! Let's use it for the next scenario!"

90002260-0149 = "It's been a while since I was here. Oh, this is your first time, Rio?"
90002260-0150 = "Yes. So this is where... everything was being done."
90002260-0151 = "After various incidents, we've finally returned here."
90002260-0152 = "...Thank you, Himari."
90002260-0153 = "Truly."
90002260-0154 = "...Yes."
90002260-0155 = "A-Anyway! With this, the Special Phenomena Task Force's job is done."
90002260-0157 = "Man, at first I thought the President and the Chairwoman were just dumping another weird job on us again."
90002260-0158 = "That's not true at all. I'm not like Rio."
90002260-0159 = "As someone who is considerate, flexible, inclusive, and sensible—"

90002260-0163 = "I think she was always like this."
90002260-0164 = "Yes. Chairwoman Rio and President Himari are truly two peas in a pod."
90002260-0165 = "As for which one wins by a narrow margin... I will refrain from commenting. Peace, peace."
90002260-0166 = "How rude! We are completely different!"
90002260-0167 = "Even among eccentrics, there's a world of difference between having a plan and not having one!?"
90002260-0168 = "[s] \"...So you admit you're an eccentric.\""
90002260-0169 = "Even you, Sensei!?"

90002260-0174 = "While it's good that we achieved so much in such a major incident..."
90002260-0175 = "It's a bit of a shame we can't make it public."
90002260-0176 = "I thought we could have added at least one line to the urban legends spreading through Kivotos—the Library of Lore."
90002260-0178 = "We eliminated the danger, so isn't that enough? #nWhat more could you want?"
90002260-0179 = "When you use logic like that, I don't have a leg to stand on..."
90002260-0180 = "Because to grant your wish, we'd have to start by announcing the existence of the Special Phenomena Task Force, wouldn't we?"
90002260-0181 = "Which means we'd have to explain the reason why you disappeared—"
90002260-0182 = "And before that, we'd need to explain the special phenomena... Decagrammaton. If that happens, your position—"
90002260-0183 = "I know! I know! I was just saying!!!!"
90002260-0185 = "I think Rio is right this time..."
90002260-0187 = "Thank you."
90002260-0188 = "Well then... even though I've only just returned, I've decided to leave again. #nIt was good to see how Millennium is doing after all this time."
90002260-0192 = "Huh?"
90002260-0194 = "Hmm?"
90002260-0195 = "Rio-sama?"

90002260-0198 = "D-Did I say something strange again...? #nI mean, we don't know when another crisis might strike Kivotos—"
90002260-0199 = "So you're saying it's more effective to operate from the shadows to prepare rationally and efficiently?"
90002260-0200 = "...!?"
90002260-0202 = "Let's have a serious talk for a moment."
90002260-0203 = "First of all, you can still work behind the scenes even if you stay at Millennium."
90002260-0204 = "I do it myself, so I can guarantee it."
90002260-0205 = "Isn't that just because your personality is a bit twisted...?"
90002260-0206 = "Pfft!?"
90002260-0207 = "Eimi...? I... I've just lost my will to live for a moment."
90002260-0208 = "It's okay. The President is so audac—I mean, thick-skinned that she won't be discouraged by something like that."
90002260-0209 = "That's right. The President Himari I know is someone who never loses herself, no matter how hard things get."
90002260-0210 = "I feel like everyone's opinion of me has been getting questionable lately..."
90002260-0213 = "In any case, your attempt to hide yourself again only makes it look like you're avoiding the students of Millennium."
90002260-0214 = "Is it mostly because you're bad at communication, or something like that?"
90002260-0215 = "..."
90002260-0216 = "Of course, I know your interpersonal skills are lacking. #nHowever, even if you're just fumbling along, you've recently started trying to understand others."
90002260-0217 = "...Therefore."
90002260-0218 = "I don't think you're a fundamentally bad person."
90002260-0219 = "So, what are you trying to say?"
90002260-0220 = "You're going to make me say it, aren't you...!"
90002260-0221 = "Listen closely, because I'm only going to say this once. #nIn short—"
90002260-0222 = "Even though you tried to do terrible things to Aris!"
90002260-0223 = "And you got emotional and did terrible things to Toki!"
90002260-0224 = "And even if you're narrow-minded, paranoid, and a stubborn person who doesn't listen to anyone!"
90002260-0225 = "Your core isn't rotten. #nAs a result, we've been saved by you time and time again."
90002260-0227 = "But... I..."
90002260-0228 = "Is something bothering you? #nIf you feel guilty, then face them and talk to them properly!"
90002260-0229 = "Anyway, what I'm trying to say is—!"
90002260-0230 = "You! You're allowed to be here! Do you understand!?"
90002260-0231 = "No, stay here! So you don't go causing trouble in secret!"
90002260-0237 = "President..."
90002260-0238 = "I see."
90002260-0239 = "...Hmph."
90002260-0243 = "Is something the matter, everyone...?"
90002260-0245 = "I was a bit moved to see that the President could say something like that. #nSince this is a tear-jerker scene, I'll put some eye drops in for you."
90002260-0246 = "I'll lend you mine. As a perfect maid and agent, I am always well-prepared."
90002260-0247 = "I recorded that whole speech. I'll share it with Aris later."
90002260-0248 = "...!"
90002260-0249 = "I knew I shouldn't have said something so out of character..."
90002260-0250 = "[s1] \"But Himari is right.\"\n[s2] \"...You've already been scolded plenty by Yuuka, haven't you?\""

90002260-0255 = "Good."
90002260-0258 = "It's safe to assume there's no longer any danger of hacking by Decagrammaton."
90002260-0259 = "Even so, there's a reason we returned to this clubroom."
90002260-0260 = "To hide Malkuth's existence from the students of Kivotos. Isn't that right?"
90002260-0265 = "I thought I would be forgotten just like this."
90002260-0266 = "Not that I would have minded if that happened."
90002260-0267 = "[s] \"Sorry... are you mad?\""
90002260-0268 = "I do not understand the intent of the question. Searching for meanings of the word 'mad' that I have not yet recognized..."
90002260-0269 = "...I still do not understand. Sensei, what kind of question is that?"
90002260-0270 = "If I don't know, then it's fine...? That makes even less sense..."
90002260-0271 = "[s3] \"M-More importantly!\"\n[s4] \"Malkuth, what do you want to do from now on?\""
90002260-0274 = "Hehe, this is just a suggestion, but—"
90002260-0275 = "If you wish, we could prepare a place for you in the Special Phenomena Task Force."
90002260-0276 = "Only if that's what you want, of course."
90002260-0277 = "Um..."
90002260-0278 = "(Wait, is this...)"
90002260-0280 = "In other words, she's saying she wants to get along and spend time together."
90002260-0281 = "Yes. President Himari can be a bit dishonest with her feelings sometimes."
90002260-0282 = "I hope her motive isn't just wanting to keep you close because you're an interesting research subject..."

90002260-0302 = "Ein, Sof, Ohr..."
90002260-0303 = "My sisters told me they wanted me to live. #nSo I intend to do so, but..."
90002260-0304 = "I still need time to define, organize, and regulate my life."
90002260-0305 = "To be honest, I don't quite understand why I've come to this conclusion either."
