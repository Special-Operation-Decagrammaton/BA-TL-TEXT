1013503-81 = "[s1] \"Of course.\"\n[s2] \"Because a student's job is to learn and to play!\""
1013503-84 = "You're just making stuff up..."
1013503-85 = "...."

1013503-97 = "There's only one of you. Do you know how many students are in Kivotos?"
1013503-98 = "Just dealing with Millennium students would be hard enough. Where does this self-confidence come from...?"
1013503-99 = "[s6] \"You're certainly right. So Kei-chan--\"\n[s7] \"You should become friends with them in my stead!\""
